#
# Script defines 3 functions, movAvg, processFile, and lineGraph.
# movAvg creates a moving average of an input vector given a window size.
# processFile utilizes movAvg function and ensures it is passed proper input
#  from the helaData dataset
# lineGraph produces a colored plot of a dataframe, plotting pieces of a data
#  frame against each other

  # the window being shortened at the ends of the vector as appropriate. This
  # will shift the average of the vector slightly.
